## Introduction

Cluster GCN can be considered a sampling method that allows to train on large scale graph machine learning datasets. Cluster GCN works on two steps. First, it clusters the data, such that each cluster is a subgraph. Second, the algorithm trains the model using a stochastic gradient estimated with a batch of sampled subgraphs.

By default, we will train with the [arXiv dataset](https://ogb.stanford.edu/docs/nodeprop/#ogbn-arxiv), which is a directed homogeneous graph encoding a citation network between all Computer Science (CS) papers hosted in arXiv and indexed by the Microsoft academic graph (MAG). Each paper has a 128-dimmensional node feature vector, that encodes the title and abstract, processed with a skip-gram model. Each directed link in the graph indicates that one paper cites another. The task is to predict the correct topic label for the paper from the 40 main categories. The train portion of the dataset is all papers published until 2017, the papers published in 2018 are the validation set, and papers published in 2019 are the test set. We wukk use the arXiv dataset, simply use the train_arxiv.json config, the dataset will be downloaded automatically.

We will also show how to train with other common datasets.

However, two of the config files described above, namely `configs/train_mag.json` and `configs/train_mag240.json` that correspond with MAG and MAG240 datasets, respectively, include heterogeneous graphs.

## Training

### Clustering the training dataset

Once we have loaded the dataset, we can cluster the associated graph, using the parameters given in the config file, mainly `config.training.num_clusters` or `config.training.max_nodes_per_batch`. The former sets the total number of clusters in which we want to split the graph. The latter specifies the maximum number of nodes per cluster. Note these are alternative methods, so we cannot specify both parameters.

Other important parameters are:
- `config.training.clusters_per_batch`: Number of clusters to be processed together in a micro-batch.

- `method_max_nodes` and `method_max_edges`: In order to maximise bandwidth, we compile the model as a static graph. This requires having static datastructures. Since the number of nodes can change from one cluster to another, we need a method to set the maximum number of nodes per cluster. If a cluster has a number of nodes smaller than what we have defined, then it will pad with a dummy node so that it fits the allocated memory, wasting computations and reducing throughput. On the other hand, if they are larger, it will remove some of them so that they fit in the allocated space, removing data and potentially reducing accuracy. Though there is a tradeoff here, and we offer three methods to optimise this tradeoff
namely `average`, `average_plus_std` and `upper_bound`, which work as follows:
    - `average` means all clusters will pad ro prune nodes so that they adjust to
the average number of nodes across all clusters;
    - `average_plus_std` means all clusters will adjust to the average number of nodes across all clusters
plus one standard deviation;
    - `upper_bound` means all clusters will pad to the number of nodes in the largest cluster.
In practice, the gains obtained by using a statically compiled graph are larger than the extra computations due to padding, even when using the `upper_bound` case.

- `method_max_edges`: Same as `method_max_nodes` but for the number of edges per cluster.

- `config.inter_cluster_ratio`: When using COO representation and sampling multiple cluster per batch, this parameter represents the extra number of edges that connect nodes that are in different that we will use. When this is zero, we can think the adjacency matrix of the batch as a pure block-diagonal matrix. If this value is greater than zero, then the adjacency matrix will have some positive values off the diagonal blocks.

- `node_edge_imbalance_ratio`: By default the METIS clustering algorithm will find clusters that have similar number of nodes, though they can have very different number of edges. Setting this parameter we can tell METIS to find a trade-off between balancing number of nodes and edges. In theory this could reduce the amount of padding when using `upper_bound` method to set number of nodes and edges, but in practice we have observed but it doesn't have much effect on throughput for the considered datasets.

We encourage you playing with different number of clusters and clusters per batch. The idea is to keep the number of nodes per batch large enough to minimise the number of lost edges, which affects accuracy, while fitting in memory, so we can benefit from the high bandwidth offered by a compiled computational graph.
