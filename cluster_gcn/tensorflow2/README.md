## Introduction <a name='intro' ></a>

This repository contains a TensorFlow 2 implementation of the Cluster-GCN algorithm, presented in
[Cluster-GCN: An Efficient Algorithm for Training Deep and Large Graph Convolutional Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.07953.pdf),
running on the Graphcore IPU. The model is a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) that performs node
classification tasks with cluster sampling approach to enable large-scale training.

## Prepare environment <a name='environment' ></a>

Create a virtual environment and install the appropriate Graphcore TensorFlow 2 wheels from inside
the SDK directory:

```shell
virtualenv --python python3.6 .gcn_venv
source .gcn_venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install <path to the TensorFlow-2 wheel from the Poplar SDK>
pip install --force-reinstall --no-deps <path to the Keras wheel from the Poplar SDK>
pip install <path to the ipu_tensorflow_addons wheel for TensorFlow 2 from the Poplar SDK>
```

This application uses [METIS](https://doi.org/10.1137/S1064827595287997) to cluster the graph. To install METIS on an Ubuntu system run the following:

```shell
sudo apt-get install libmetis-dev=5.1.0.dfsg-5
```


## Datasets <a name='datasets' ></a>

This implementation of Cluster-GCN running on the Graphcore IPUs supports the following graph datasets
for node prediction. Each of these datasets have a corresponding configuration file that works well, otherwise
these datasets can be selected in the config by setting `dataset_type`.

### PPI (Protein-protein interactions) dataset <a name='ppi' ></a>

The [PPI dataset](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/ppi) depicts protein roles in various protein-protein 
interaction (PPI) graphs. Each graph in the datasets corresponds to a different human tissue. Positional gene sets are
used, motif gene sets and immunological signatures as features and gene ontology sets as multi-class binary labels 
(121 in total). The dataset contains in total 56944 nodes, 818716 edges and node feature size 50. The preprocessed PPI 
datasets can be downloaded from [Stanford GraphSAGE](https://snap.stanford.edu/graphsage).

### Reddit dataset <a name='reddit' ></a>

The [Reddit dataset](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/reddit) is a homogeneous graph dataset from Reddit posts made
in the month of September 2014. The node label in this case is the community that a post belongs to. There are 50
large communities  sampled to build a post-to-post graph, connecting posts if the same user comments on both. This
dataset contains in total 232,965 nodes with node feature size of 602 and 114615892 edges. The preprocessed Reddit
datasets can be downloaded from [Stanford GraphSAGE](https://snap.stanford.edu/graphsage).

### arXiv dataset <a name='arxiv' ></a>

The [ogbn-arxiv dataset](https://ogb.stanford.edu/docs/nodeprop/#ogbn-arxiv) is a directed homogeneous graph that
encodes a citation network between computer science papers hosted on arXiv. Each paper has a 128-dimmensional node
feature vector, that encodes the title and abstract, processed with a skip-gram model. Each directed link in the
graph indicates that one paper cites another. The task is to predict the correct topic label for the paper from the
40 main categories. The train portion of the dataset is all papers published until 2017, the papers published in 2018
are the validation set, and papers published in 2019 are the test set. To use the arXiv dataset, simply use the
train_arxiv.json config, the dataset will be downloaded automatically.

### Products dataset <a name='products' ></a>

The [ogbn-products dataset](https://ogb.stanford.edu/docs/nodeprop/#ogbn-products) is an undirected homogeneous graph that encodes a
network of products. Each product has a 100-dimmensional node feature vector, that encodes the product descriptions.
Each node in the graph represents a product sold in Amazon, with the edges indicating if products are bought together.
The task is to predict the correct category label for a product from the 47 main categories. The train portion of the
dataset makes up only 8% of the dataset and are based on the products sale ranking. 2% validation and the other 90% used
for test. To use this dataset, simply use the train_products.json config, the dataset will be downloaded automatically.

### MAG dataset <a name='mag' ></a>

The [ogbn-mag dataset](https://ogb.stanford.edu/docs/nodeprop/#ogbn-mag) is a directed heterogeneous graph that is
a subset of Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG). The node types are papers, authors, institutions and fields of study.
These are connected by four edge types, author affiliated with institution, author writes a paper, paper cites a paper,
and paper has a topic of a field of study. Each paper has a 128-dimmensional node feature vector, that 
encodes the title and abstract, similar to ogbn-arxiv. The task is to predict the venue of each paper. The train
portion of the dataset is all papers published until 2017, the papers published in 2018 are the validation 
set, and papers published in 2019 are the test set. To use this dataset, simply use the train_mag.json config,
the dataset will be downloaded automatically.

### MAG240M dataset <a name='mag240m' ></a>

The [MAG240M dataset](https://ogb.stanford.edu/docs/lsc/mag240m/) is a directed heterogeneous graph that is
a subset of Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG). It is very similar to the above ogbn-mag dataset but is a much larger
subset. The node types are papers, authors, institutions and fields of study. These are connected by four edge types,
author affiliated with institution, author writes a paper, paper cites a paper, and paper has a topic of a field of
study. Each paper has a 768-dimmensional node feature vector, that encodes the title and abstract, similar to
ogbn-arxiv. Only a subset of the papers are the arXiv papers and these are the ones used for training and validation.
The task is to predict the subject areas of these papers. The train portion of the dataset is all papers published
until 2018, the papers published in 2019 are the validation set, and papers published in 2020 are the test set.

This dataset is considerably larger than the others mentioned above. We use the same approach as the
[DeepMind entry for MAG240M-LSC](https://github.com/deepmind/deepmind-research/blob/master/ogb_lsc/mag/README.md#download-and-pre-process-data),
which uses PCA to reduce the feature size. There a script is provided to pre-process the data as well as a script to
download the pre-processed data directly, which you can download from
[DeepMindâ€™s cloud storage](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-ogb-lsc/mag/data/preprocessed/merged_feat_from_paper_feat_pca_129.npy).
Note that the dataset is licensed under ODC-BY.
The path for the downloaded `.npy` file can be given in the `train_mag240.json` config under the `pca_features_path` 
parameter, which is expected relative to the data path. 
The other parts of the dataset, for example the edges, nodes and labels, will be downloaded automatically when running
the application. The dataset is around 200Gb so can take some time to download (a few hours to a day). The path of this
can be given in the `train_mag240.json` config under `data_path`, or with the `--data-path` argument in the command 
line. 
For example, the following configuration will load the data from or download to directory
`/graph-datasets/ogb-lsc-mag240`, and will attempt to load the PCA features from file
`/graph-datasets/ogb-lsc-mag240/mag240m_kddcup2021/merged_feat_from_paper_feat_pca_129.npy`:
```json
{
   "data_path": "/localdata/graph-datasets/ogb-lsc-mag240",
   "pca_features_path": "/mag240m_kddcup2021/merged_feat_from_paper_feat_pca_129.npy"
}
```

## Run training and validation <a name='training_validation' ></a>

```shell
python run_cluster_gcn.py CONFIG_FILE --data-path [PATH_TO_DATA]
```

We provide multiple example config files in the `./configs` directory, including `train_ppi.json`, `train_arxiv.json`, 
`train_reddit.json`, etc. 

For detailed information about the parameters that can be used in the config files, 
we suggest looking at the code and comments in `./utilities/options.py`. 
Depending on the chosen configuration, the program trains and validates Cluster-GCN model on the selected dataset
using METIS for clustering. 

Some parameters can be modified via the config file or by using the command line arguments. 
In the case the same parameter is passed in both the config file and as an argument in the 
command line, the value of the latter takes preference and is the one used.

## Distributed training <a name='distributed_training' ></a>

To launch a single host multi-instance run, simply do:

```shell
poprun \
    --vipu-partition=VIPU_PARTITION_NAME \
    --mpi-global-args="--tag-output" \
    --num-replicas=NUM_REPLICAS \
    --num-instances=NUM_INSTANCES \
    --executable-cache-path=CACHE_PATH \
python \
    run_cluster_gcn.py CONFIG_FILE \
    --data-path DATA_PATH \
    --training.replicas NUM_REPLICAS \
    --training.epochs-per-execution EPOCHS_PER_EXECUTION
```

Note that the `NUM_INSTANCES` should be divisible by `NUM_REPLICAS`
and it is recommended to use `EPOCHS_PER_EXECUTION` equal to the `NUM_INSTANCES` 
for best balance between accuracy and performance.

## Benchmarking

To reproduce the benchmarks, please follow the setup instructions in this README to setup the environment, and then from this dir, use the `examples_utils` module to run one or more benchmarks. For example:
```
python3 -m examples_utils benchmark --spec benchmarks.yml
```

or to run a specific benchmark in the `benchmarks.yml` file provided:
```
python3 -m examples_utils benchmark --spec benchmarks.yml --benchmark <benchmark_name>
```

For more information on how to use the examples_utils benchmark functionality, please see the <a>benchmarking readme<a href=<https://github.com/graphcore/examples-utils/tree/master/examples_utils/benchmarks>

## Profiling

Profiling can be done easily via the `examples_utils` module, simply by adding the `--profile` argument when using the `benchmark` submodule (see the <strong>Benchmarking</strong> section above for further details on use). For example:
```
python3 -m examples_utils benchmark --spec benchmarks.yml --profile
```
Will create folders containing popvision profiles in this applications root directory (where the benchmark has to be run from), each folder ending with "_profile". 

The `--profile` argument works by allowing the `examples_utils` module to update the `POPLAR_ENGINE_OPTIONS` environment variable in the environment the benchmark is being run in, by setting:
```
POPLAR_ENGINE_OPTIONS = {
    "autoReport.all": "true",
    "autoReport.directory": <current_working_directory>,
    "autoReport.outputSerializedGraph": "false",
}
```
Which can also be done manually by exporting this variable in the benchmarking environment, if custom options are needed for this variable.
